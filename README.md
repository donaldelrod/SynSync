# SynSync

This project stemmed from my desire to have a server-like program running on my computer that could connect to any number of mobile devices, and control them remotely. Originally this was meant to be able to connect to Android phones, smart appliances and eventually iPhones (or at least jailbroken iPhones), however this is what remains of the catastrophic event of losing your flash dive that hasn't been backed up in a month.

This project was started around 2013-2014, and no work has been done on it since (with the exception of the work that was lost in above heartbreak). I recently found these old Java programs in one of my old hard drives, and will try to finish them out when I find time. Please feel free to contact me if you would like to help, have ideas or questions, or want to tell me how poor my coding style was when I wrote this!
